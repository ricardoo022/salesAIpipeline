# pipeline/

The analysis scripts that form the pipeline. Each is a standalone Python script — no shared state, no imports between scripts. Data flows exclusively through JSON files in `output/`.

WhisperX and pyannote run **in parallel on the same WAV** — WhisperX answers *what was said* (with word-level timestamps), pyannote answers *who was speaking* (and when). `merge_speaker_labels()` joins them by maximum time overlap to produce a single enriched transcript.

## Scripts

## Modules

### `audio.py`
`extract_audio(video_path, output_path=None)` — ffmpeg wrapper. Extracts 16kHz mono WAV from a video file. Returns the output path.

### `transcribe.py`
- `transcribe_audio(audio_path)` — loads WhisperX large-v2 on CPU (int8), transcribes and aligns. Returns aligned segments.
- `merge_speaker_labels(segments, diarization)` — assigns speaker labels to transcript segments by maximum time overlap. Unmatched segments get `speaker: "UNKNOWN"`.

### `features.py`
`extract_audio_features(transcript, audio_path)` — loads audio with `librosa.load`, iterates each diarized segment and computes pitch (librosa.pyin), energy (librosa.feature.rms), speech rate (word count / duration), pause ratio (inter-word gaps / duration), and zero crossing rate. Edge cases handled: empty segments, all-unvoiced frames, overlapping words, missing words array.

### `diarize.py`
`diarize_audio(audio_path, hf_token)` — runs pyannote `speaker-diarization-3.1` on the audio file. Answers *who spoke when*, not *what* was said. Returns a list of turns `[{speaker, start, end}]` with generic labels (`SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01`, …). The `hf_token` (HuggingFace access token) is required — pyannote's model is gated and must be accepted at huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 before use.

> **Note:** `from pyannote.audio import Pipeline` is imported *inside* the function body, not at module level. pyannote loads PyTorch on import and crashes in CPU-only environments without CUDA libs. The deferred import lets the module load cleanly and fail early on missing inputs before touching pyannote.

### `emotion_voice.py`
`extract_voice_emotion(segments, audio_path, model_path=None)` — loads the audeering `wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion-msp-dim` model and runs it per segment to produce valence, arousal, dominance (continuous 0–1). Segments >15s are split into ≤15s chunks; chunk predictions are averaged. Empty segments default to 0.0.

> **Architecture caveat:** The model's `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification` head class was **removed from modern `transformers`** (4.57.6). Loading with stock `Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification` silently random-initializes the head (wrong weight names) and produces a flat-line output. The module reconstructs `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification` + `Wav2Vec2ClassificationHead` as custom classes matching the saved weight names (`classifier.dense`, `classifier.out_proj`) so `from_pretrained` loads the real trained weights.
>
> **Post-processing caveat:** This is a **regression head** (`problem_type: "regression"`), not a classifier. Do **not** apply `torch.sigmoid()` — outputs are VAD dimensions directly. Clip to [0,1] with `np.clip`. Applying sigmoid compresses all variation to a narrow band around 0.5, defeating the model.
>
> **Output order caveat:** Model returns `[arousal, dominance, valence]` per `config.json` (`id2label: {0: arousal, 1: dominance, 2: valence}`). The output dict reorders to `{valence, arousal, dominance}` via `VALENCE_IDX=2`, `AROUSAL_IDX=0`, `DOMINANCE_IDX=1`. Getting this wrong silently mislabels every field.

### `emotion_face.py`
`extract_face_emotion(video_path, interval=10)` — samples one frame every 10 seconds from the video via OpenCV (`_iter_frames`), runs DeepFace emotion analysis on each frame (`_analyze_frame`), and skips frames with no detected face (no crash). Returns a list of `{timestamp, dominant_emotion, scores}` where `scores` is a dict of 7 emotion probabilities normalized to 0–1.

> **Detector backend caveat:** DeepFace's default `opencv` detector backend needs the haarcascade XMLs in `cv2/data/`, but `opencv-python` 5.x ships that directory empty (only `__init__.py`). The default backend raises `ValueError` on every frame, which the module's `except ValueError` (no-face handler) silently swallows as "no face" → 0 frames output. The module sets `DETECTOR_BACKEND = "retinaface"` (a deepface dependency that ships its own weights) to avoid this.
>
> **Score range caveat:** DeepFace returns emotion scores as **0–100 percentages**, not 0–1. `_shape_emotion_result` divides by 100 (then rounds to 4 decimals) to match the spec schema and the 0–1 range used by step 3 (voice emotion). Getting this wrong feeds 0–100 values into the step-5 LLM prompt (written for 0–1) and breaks step-6 chart axes.
>
> **Lazy imports:** `cv2` and `deepface` are imported *inside* the functions that need them (`_iter_frames`, `_analyze_frame`), not at module level — mirroring the pyannote pattern in `diarize.py`. This keeps the module import instant and lets the 13 unit tests run with neither cv2 nor deepface installed (they patch the seams / inject a `sys.modules` fake).

### `llm_analysis.py`
`run_analysis(transcript_path, audio_features_path, voice_emotion_path, face_emotion_path, output_path, api_key)` — loads the four upstream JSONs, projects them into compact per-segment blocks (dropping word timestamps / `avg_logprob`), calls the Claude API **twice** (transcript-only, then multimodal), injects a deterministically-computed `talk_ratio` into both outputs, and writes `output/analysis.json` as `{transcript_only, multimodal}`. Pure helpers (`_format_timestamp`, `_classify_speakers`, `_compute_talk_ratio`, `_merge_segments`, `_build_transcript_prompt`, `_build_multimodal_prompt`) are the testable seams; `_call_claude` is the single API seam.

> **Structured output:** the model is forced to emit JSON via Claude **tool-use** (`tool_choice={"type": "tool", "name": "submit_analysis"}`) rather than parsing free text. The tool schema requires `engagement_score`, `deal_probability`, `critical_moments[]` (each with `timestamp`/`type`/`description`/`coaching`), and `recommendations[]`. `talk_ratio` is deliberately **not** in the schema — it's computed from transcript talk-time (`_compute_talk_ratio`) and injected into both modes, because LLMs are unreliable at exact arithmetic and talk ratio is a measured fact.
>
> **Truncation guard:** `MAX_TOKENS=8192`. Forced `tool_choice` guarantees a `tool_use` *block* exists, but under a too-small `max_tokens` the multimodal call can emit a *valid-but-incomplete* input (e.g. `critical_moments` closes before `recommendations` is emitted) that silently flows into `analysis.json`. `_call_claude` checks `stop_reason == "max_tokens"` and `_validate_analysis` asserts all required fields present, turning a silent schema violation into a loud failure. (With `max_tokens=4096` the multimodal block shipped with 15 `critical_moments` and zero `recommendations` — the bug this guard prevents.)
>
> **Speaker → REP/PROSPECT:** `_classify_speakers()` maps diarization labels (`SPEAKER_00/01/02`) to `REP`/`PROSPECT`/`OTHER` by total talk time (longest = REP). A deterministic, testable default — not an extra API call.
>
> **Lazy import:** `anthropic` is imported *inside* `_call_claude()`, not at module level — mirroring the pyannote/cv2-deepface pattern. This keeps the module import instant and lets the 63 unit tests run without the `anthropic` SDK installed (they inject a fake into `sys.modules["anthropic"]` and clean it up in `finally` blocks).
