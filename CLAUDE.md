# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

Multimodal sales meeting analysis pipeline. Takes a B2B sales meeting video and produces an HTML report with engagement scores, deal probability, talk ratio, emotional timeline, critical moments, and coaching recommendations. The killer feature is a side-by-side comparison between transcript-only analysis vs full multimodal analysis — this is a demo aimed at Portuguese B2B sales consulting company Scale Labs.


## Finding context

Prefer `.codegraph/` (via the `codegraph_explore` MCP tool) over grepping/reading files to locate a symbol, trace who calls a function, or see a function's blast radius before editing it — it's a pre-built index of the repo's symbols and call graph, cheaper and more accurate than re-deriving that by hand.

## Pipeline Architecture

Six sequential steps, each a standalone Python script. Output of each step is a JSON file consumed by the next:

```
input/meeting.mp4
  → pipeline/01_transcribe.py      → output/transcript.json      (WhisperX large-v2 ✓ | pyannote diarization ✓ | merge speaker labels ✓)
  → pipeline/02_audio_features.py  → output/audio_features.json  (librosa: pitch mean/std, energy mean, speech rate, pause ratio, ZCR)
  → pipeline/03_emotion_voice.py   → output/voice_emotion.json   (audeering wav2vec2: valence, arousal, dominance per segment ✓)
  → pipeline/04_emotion_face.py    → output/face_emotion.json    (DeepFace retinaface, every 10s, scores normalized 0–1 ✓)
  → pipeline/05_llm_analysis.py    → output/analysis.json        (Claude API, run twice: transcript-only + multimodal ✓)
  → pipeline/06_report.py          → output/report.html           (pure HTML + Chart.js via CDN ✓)
```

`run.py` at root orchestrates all six steps in sequence, skipping any step whose output file already exists.

### Module/script split

The numbered scripts (`01_transcribe.py` etc.) are CLI entry points — they handle file paths, `sys.exit`, and print progress. Shared logic lives in importable modules alongside them:

- `pipeline/audio.py` — `extract_audio()` — ffmpeg wrapper
- `pipeline/transcribe.py` — `transcribe_audio()`, `merge_speaker_labels()` — WhisperX load + align; speaker label assignment by max time overlap
- `pipeline/diarize.py` — `diarize_audio()` — pyannote speaker-diarization-3.1 wrapper
- `pipeline/features.py` — `extract_audio_features()` — librosa pitch, energy, speech rate, pause ratio, ZCR per segment
- `pipeline/emotion_voice.py` — `extract_voice_emotion()` — audeering wav2vec2 VAD per segment; reconstructs `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification` head (class removed from modern transformers)
- `pipeline/emotion_face.py` — `extract_face_emotion()` — DeepFace emotion per sampled frame (every 10s); retinaface detector, scores normalized 0–1, no-face frames skipped
- `pipeline/llm_analysis.py` — `run_analysis()` — merges the 4 upstream JSONs, calls Claude twice (transcript-only + multimodal) with forced tool-use; deterministic talk_ratio; lazy-imports anthropic
- `pipeline/report.py` — `render_report(transcript, audio_features, voice_emotion, face_emotion, analysis, meeting_title=...)` — assembles the self-contained HTML string; pure stdlib (`json` + string building), no lazy imports needed. Data-shaping helpers (`_build_timeline_series`, `_build_comparison`, `_build_proof_examples`, `_prosody_by_role`, `_vad_by_role`, `_face_emotion_distribution`, `_compare_role_stat`, `_moment_tag`, etc.) are the testable seams. Report copy is European Portuguese, written for a non-technical sales audience (see "Signal glossary" below); the LLM's own generated text (`critical_moments`, `recommendations`) is rendered verbatim in whatever language step 5 produced it in, same treatment as transcript quotes.

Tests import the modules directly with mocks; they never call the numbered scripts (except the subprocess tests for the CLI guards). New logic for each step should follow this pattern.

### Import path duality

Scripts use bare imports (`from audio import extract_audio`) because Python adds the script's own directory to `sys.path` when run directly. Tests use package imports (`from pipeline.audio import extract_audio`) because pytest runs from the project root and `pipeline/__init__.py` makes it a package. Both work; don't add `sys.path` manipulation to either.

### pyannote lazy import

`pipeline/diarize.py` does `from pyannote.audio import Pipeline` **inside** `diarize_audio()`, not at module level. This is intentional: pyannote imports torch at module load time and crashes in CPU-only environments that lack CUDA libs. The deferred import lets the CLI scripts load cleanly and fail early on missing video/token before touching pyannote.

Tests stub pyannote by injecting into `sys.modules` before the module is first imported:
```python
_mock_pyannote = MagicMock()
sys.modules.setdefault("pyannote", _mock_pyannote)
sys.modules.setdefault("pyannote.audio", _mock_pyannote)
```

### audeering head reconstruction (Step 3)

`pipeline/emotion_voice.py` reconstructs `Wav2Vec2ForSpeechClassification` + `Wav2Vec2ClassificationHead` as custom classes. The audeering model ships this head architecture (mean-pool hidden states → 2-layer MLP → regression), but the class was **removed from modern transformers** (4.57.6). Loading with stock `Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification` silently random-initializes the head (wrong weight names) and produces a flat-line output. The custom class matches the saved weight names (`classifier.dense`, `classifier.out_proj`) so `from_pretrained` loads the real trained weights.

The model is a **regression head** (`problem_type: "regression"`), not a classifier. Do **not** apply `torch.sigmoid()` — outputs are VAD dimensions directly. Clip to [0,1] with `np.clip` instead.

Output order is `{0: arousal, 1: dominance, 2: valence}` per `config.json`. The output dict reorders to `{valence, arousal, dominance}` via `VALENCE_IDX=2`, `AROUSAL_IDX=0`, `DOMINANCE_IDX=1`. Getting this wrong silently mislabels every field.

### DeepFace detector backend + score normalization (Step 4)

`pipeline/emotion_face.py` sets `DETECTOR_BACKEND = "retinaface"` explicitly. DeepFace's default `opencv` detector backend needs the haarcascade XMLs in `cv2/data/`, but **`opencv-python` 5.x ships that directory empty** (only `__init__.py`), so the default backend raises `ValueError` on every frame — silently swallowed by the `except ValueError` (no-face handler) as "no face", producing 0 frames. retinaface is a deepface dependency and ships its own weights (auto-downloaded to `~/.deepface/weights/`).

DeepFace returns emotion scores as **0–100 percentages**, not 0–1. `_shape_emotion_result` divides by 100 (then rounds to 4 decimals) to match the spec schema and step 3's VAD range. Getting this wrong feeds 0–100 values into the step-5 LLM prompt (written for 0–1).

`cv2` and `deepface` are lazy-imported inside `_iter_frames`/`_analyze_frame` (same pattern as pyannote in `diarize.py`), so the module loads without TensorFlow and the 13 unit tests run dep-free (patching the seams / injecting a `sys.modules` fake).

### Claude tool-use + truncation guard (Step 5)

`pipeline/llm_analysis.py` forces structured output via Claude **tool-use** (`tool_choice={"type": "tool", "name": "submit_analysis"}`) rather than parsing free text — the model is constrained to emit JSON matching `ANALYSIS_TOOL.input_schema`, so the analysis is always well-formed. `anthropic` is lazy-imported inside `_call_claude()` (same pattern as pyannote/cv2-deepface) so the unit tests run without the SDK, injecting a fake into `sys.modules["anthropic"]`.

**MAX_TOKENS truncation gotcha:** with `max_tokens=4096`, the multimodal call surfaced 13–15 detailed `critical_moments` that consumed the entire budget before `recommendations` was emitted — the tool_use block closed `critical_moments` and the partial JSON parsed into a *valid-but-incomplete* dict (missing `recommendations`), which silently flowed into `analysis.json`. Forced `tool_choice` guarantees a tool_use *block*, not a *complete* one. The guard is three-layered: `MAX_TOKENS=8192`, a `stop_reason == "max_tokens"` check, and `_validate_analysis()` asserting all required fields present. Getting this wrong ships a broken multimodal block that step 6 renders as if complete.

**Deterministic talk_ratio:** `talk_ratio` is computed from transcript talk-time (`_compute_talk_ratio`), not LLM-generated — LLMs are unreliable at exact arithmetic. It's injected into both `transcript_only` and `multimodal` outputs, so the ratio is identical and correct across modes (the tool schema deliberately omits it).

**Speaker → REP/PROSPECT:** diarization yields `SPEAKER_00/01/02`; `_classify_speakers()` maps by talk time (longest = REP, second = PROSPECT, rest = OTHER) — a deterministic, testable default, not an extra API call.

### Hidden-signals proof section (Step 6)

The report's most persuasive element isn't the headline `engagement_score`/`deal_probability` — on real calls those often land identical between `transcript_only` and `multimodal` (the LLM's holistic scoring is inherently noisy/similar across both prompts), which undercuts the "multimodal is better" pitch if that's the only evidence shown. Instead, `pipeline/report.py` leads with a structurally-guaranteed differentiator: `_count_dissonance_moments()` counts `critical_moments` the LLM tagged as `"Dissonance – ..."` (matched on the English substring the LLM actually generates — see Step 5's system prompt) — words-vs-tone/face mismatches, which the multimodal prompt explicitly asks it to surface (`_build_multimodal_prompt` in `llm_analysis.py`: *"Surface moments where the words and the voice/face disagree"*). Transcript-only analysis structurally cannot produce this category — it has no voice/face signal to contrast against — so the comparison (e.g. "transcript-only caught 0, multimodal caught 7") is real and non-technical-audience-friendly, unlike a flat score delta. The report displays this category as "Contradição" (`_moment_tag()`), not a literal translation of "dissonance" — plainer word, same underlying `"dissonance"` match.

The proof cards themselves are numbers-first, not LLM prose: `_build_proof_examples()` re-derives the evidence from the raw `transcript`/`voice_emotion`/`face_emotion` JSONs (via `_nearest_entry()`, a generic nearest-timestamp lookup) rather than reusing the LLM's paraphrased `description` field — an exact quote + measured `"85% positivo"` voice tone + measured `"97% triste"` face reading is self-verifying evidence for a reader who will never watch the source video, whereas prose asks them to trust the model's summary. Examples are ranked by `_face_sentiment()`-vs-`valence` contradiction strength (not chronological order); the strongest one becomes the report's hero moment, the rest render as a shorter proof log.

### Signal glossary and Portuguese report copy (Step 6)

The report is written in European Portuguese for a non-technical sales audience (Scale Labs' own consultants), and its first content section is a glossary table that translates every one of the 9 continuous signals (6 prosody fields from `audio_features.json` — `pitch_mean`, `pitch_std`, `energy_mean`, `speech_rate`, `pause_ratio`, `zcr` — plus the 3 voice VAD fields from `voice_emotion.json`) into a plain "what a high reading means / what a low reading means" pair, followed by the real REP-vs-PROSPECT number for that specific call. This exists because the raw field names (and even translated labels like "Assertividade") mean nothing to a reader who doesn't know the pipeline — a bare "58%" answers nothing until it's anchored to "confident, or an objection forming" and to the actual number from this call. `render_report()` now takes `audio_features` as a required argument (previously report.py never read `audio_features.json` at all) to power this table and a "Como analisamos esta chamada" mechanism strip that shows all 5 pipeline stages (4 measurement stages + the LLM interpretation stage), making explicit that the VAD/prosody numbers are direct measurements that never pass through the LLM — only `engagement_score`/`deal_probability`/`critical_moments` do.

`_compare_role_stat()` is the generic templated-sentence generator behind every glossary row's "nesta chamada" column: given a REP value, a PROSPECT value, and three sentence templates (prospect-higher / rep-higher / similar-within-15%), it picks the right one so the same row reads correctly regardless of which role happens to score higher in a given meeting — the glossary isn't hardcoded to this one demo call.

Facial emotion also gets a whole-call distribution (`_face_emotion_distribution()`), not just the isolated proof-moment readings — all 7 DeepFace categories are shown, including the ones that scored zero for this call, so "what we measure" reads as complete rather than cherry-picked.

212 tests: `pipeline/audio.py` (extract_audio, 6 tests), `pipeline/transcribe.py` (transcribe_audio, 4 tests; merge_speaker_labels, 4 tests), `pipeline/diarize.py` (diarize_audio, 4 tests), `pipeline/features.py` (extract_audio_features — 17 tests: 14 mocked + 3 integration with real WAV), `pipeline/emotion_voice.py` (extract_voice_emotion — 10 tests: 9 mocked + 1 integration with real model, skip-guarded if cache missing), `pipeline/emotion_face.py` (extract_face_emotion — 16 tests: 13 mocked/pure unit + 2 cv2 integration + 1 skip-guarded full DeepFace integration), `pipeline/01_transcribe.py` subprocess guards (2 tests: missing video, missing HF_TOKEN), `pipeline/02_audio_features.py` subprocess guards (2 tests: missing transcript, missing audio), `pipeline/03_emotion_voice.py` subprocess guards (2 tests: missing segments, missing audio), `pipeline/04_emotion_face.py` subprocess guard (1 test: missing video), `pipeline/llm_analysis.py` (run_analysis — 63 tests: 35 pure unit + 8 mocked-seam with a fake `anthropic` injected into `sys.modules` + 5 orchestration + 14 real-data tests on the actual `output/*.json` + 1 skip-guarded live Claude integration), `pipeline/05_llm_analysis.py` subprocess guards (2 tests: missing inputs, missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), `pipeline/report.py` (render_report + data-shaping helpers including the dissonance-proof pipeline, the signal glossary, and the prosody/VAD/face-distribution role comparisons, 77 tests: pure unit, no mocks needed), `pipeline/06_report.py` subprocess guards (2 tests: missing inputs, writes report.html).

Two real-model integration tests (`test_emotion_face.py::TestExtractFaceEmotionIntegration::test_with_real_meeting_video`, `test_emotion_voice.py::TestExtractVoiceEmotionIntegration::test_with_real_sine_tone`) segfault if run in the same process — a native library conflict between TensorFlow (DeepFace) and PyTorch (transformers) when both load real models in one pytest run, not a code bug. Deselect one when running the full suite together: `python -m pytest tests/ --deselect tests/test_emotion_face.py::TestExtractFaceEmotionIntegration::test_with_real_meeting_video`.

## Key Design Decisions

**Voice emotion model**: `audeering/wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion-msp-dim` — outputs valence, arousal, dominance (continuous 0–1) per segment. Better than training on RAVDESS for naturalistic speech. Regression head — no sigmoid; clip to [0,1]. Model outputs `[arousal, dominance, valence]` per config.json; the module reorders to `{valence, arousal, dominance}` in the output dict.

**Facial emotion**: DeepFace with `detector_backend="retinaface"` (the default `opencv` backend is broken — `opencv-python` 5.x omits the haarcascade XMLs from `cv2/data/`, so it raises `ValueError` on every frame and the no-face handler swallows it → 0 frames). One frame every 10s via OpenCV seek. DeepFace returns 0–100 percentages; the module normalizes to 0–1 to match the spec and step 3's VAD range. Frames with no detected face are skipped (no crash).

**Segment granularity**: Speaker turns from diarization, capped at 15 seconds. Longer turns split into 15s chunks. This gives natural speech units at consistent granularity for the emotion model.

**LLM analysis runs twice**: Step 5 calls Claude API with two different prompts — once with text only, once with all modalities — and saves both outputs. The report renders them side-by-side.

**No GPU assumed**: Pipeline runs on CPU (WSL Ubuntu). WhisperX and the audeering model will be slow on long videos.

**Model cache**: The audeering wav2vec2 model is downloaded once and cached in `models/` at project root.

## Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| WhisperX | Word-level transcription + forced alignment |
| pyannote.audio | Speaker diarization (who said what, when) |
| librosa | Audio feature extraction (pitch, energy, speech rate, pauses, ZCR) |
| transformers (audeering model) | Voice emotion: valence / arousal / dominance per segment |
| DeepFace | Facial emotion per frame (sampled every 10s) |
| Anthropic Claude API | LLM insights — model: claude-sonnet-4-6 |

## Output JSON Schemas

**transcript.json**: Array of `{speaker, start, end, text, words[]}` — word-level timestamps from WhisperX, speaker label from pyannote via `merge_speaker_labels()`. Unmatched segments get `speaker: "UNKNOWN"`.

**audio_features.json**: Array of `{speaker, start, end, pitch_mean, pitch_std, energy_mean, speech_rate, pause_ratio, zcr}` — one entry per diarized segment.

**voice_emotion.json**: Array of `{speaker, start, end, valence, arousal, dominance}` — one entry per segment (max 15s chunks).

**face_emotion.json**: Array of `{timestamp, dominant_emotion, scores{}}` — one entry per 10s video sample. `scores` are 7 emotion probabilities normalized to 0–1 (DeepFace returns 0–100). Frames with no detected face are skipped (no crash).

**analysis.json**: `{transcript_only: {...}, multimodal: {...}}` — both LLM outputs with engagement_score, deal_probability, critical_moments[], recommendations[], talk_ratio. Each `critical_moments[]` entry is `{timestamp: "HH:MM:SS", type, description, coaching}`; `type` values prefixed `"Dissonance – ..."` are what `pipeline/report.py` counts/surfaces as hidden-signal proof (see Step 6 below).
